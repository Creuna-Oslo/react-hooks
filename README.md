## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

The point of this library is not to provide npm-like packages that fit every use case. Rather, these hooks are a good starting point for getting you part of the way quickly.

## üìï Documentation

There are jsdocs documentation at the top of each file, along with the author name.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Contributing

We want your hooks! Whenever you make a hook that feels like it could be useful for other client projects, please consider putting it here by submitting a pull request!

Here are some recommendations for adding hooks:

- Add a readme file in the hook folder. It should at least mention who the author is. A description and a list of dependencies is also useful.
- Try to make the hook as general as possible before uploading. This will make using the hook a lot easier for other people.
  - Try to remove any business or project specific logic from the component. More generic is better.
